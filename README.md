- 👋 Hi, I’m @Codesurfer44! My professional journey began 10 years ago in the industrial automation world, where I gained hands-on experience in building industrial machines, performing maintenance on a range of factory equipment and developing electrical systems for industrial machinery as well as Building Management Systems (BMS). Now, I’m transitioning to the IT field, eager to achieve new milestones.
- 👀 I’m passionate about developing skills in the IT sector to land my first job and create fun, innovative projects along the way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive front-end applications. Besides front-end development, I’m also deeply interested in cybersecurity and IoT engineering. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small-sized projects to build my portfolio, learn from others, and gradually tackle larger, more complex challenges.
- 📫 How to reach me? Its simple, just send a letter to codesurfer@hotmail.com and lets build something cool together.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My Arduino-powered lock for my storage container comes with a unique key, but it’s programmed to troll the holder of the key with ‘Access Denied’ every few tries. Comedy gold, right?
