- 👋 Hi, I’m @Codesurfer44! My professional journey began 10 years ago in the industrial automation world, where I gained hands-on experience in building industrial machines, performing maintenance on a range of factory equipment and developing electrical systems for industrial machinery. Now, I’m transitioning to the IT field, eager to achieve new milestones.

- 🌱 I am currently studying Information Systems Development at TalTech University, where I’m developing my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core for web application development. I also have a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS and a strong interest for web applications and IoT engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small-sized projects to build my portfolio, learn from others, and gradually tackle larger, more complex challenges.
